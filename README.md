# OpenWrite

**Open-source, AI-powered writing platform for novelists, screenwriters, and creative writers. ✨📝**

OpenWrite helps you plan, organize, and write long-form fiction — with an AI assistant that runs on **your own API keys**. No subscription, no markup on tokens, no lock-in. Your manuscript lives in your database (or ours, or one you self-host).

**Try it:** [openwrite.iliareingold.com](https://openwrite.iliareingold.com)

![One sentence becomes a connected story map: a premise node expands into acts, acts into chapters, and a chapter is promoted straight into the manuscript](.github/story-map-demo.gif)

*One sentence in → a connected story map out. Expand any node with AI, then promote chapters straight into your manuscript.*

## What works today

- 🗺️ **Story map (node-based AI generation)** — describe your story in one sentence, then expand it level by level: premise → acts → chapters → scenes, each generated as connected nodes on a visual canvas with auto-layout. Chapter nodes promote directly into your manuscript
- ✍️ **Rich text editor with auto-save** — a distraction-light Tiptap editor that persists your manuscript as you type, with live word counts and per-project progress tracking
- 📖 **Chapter management** — create, rename, reorder, and write per-chapter, with safe concurrent-edit detection
- 🤖 **AI writing assistant (bring your own key)** — chat with an assistant that knows your project's title, genre, and characters, then insert its suggestions straight into your manuscript. Supported providers:
  - OpenRouter (one key, hundreds of models — easiest start)
  - OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Gemini, Cohere
  - Ollama (fully local models, fully private)
- 📚 **Codex** — structured world-building: characters, locations, lore entries, and plot points, organized per project
- 📤 **Markdown export** — download your full manuscript as Markdown
- 🗂️ **Projects** — novels, trilogies, series, short story collections, screenplays; genre, status, and target word count tracking
- 🔐 **Auth & workspaces** — email/password accounts with personal workspaces; API keys are encrypted at rest (AES-GCM)

## Why OpenWrite

- **Your keys, your costs.** Tools like Sudowrite resell AI tokens at a markup. OpenWrite talks to providers directly with your key — you pay provider rates, or nothing at all with local Ollama models.
- **Your words, your data.** AGPL-3.0 licensed and self-hostable on Cloudflare's free tier. No training on your manuscript, no vendor holding your novel hostage.
- **Built for fiction.** Characters, lore, and plot structure are first-class concepts, not folders of notes.

## Tech stack

TypeScript end to end: React 19 + TanStack Router + TailwindCSS/shadcn-ui on the front, Hono on Cloudflare Workers with D1 (SQLite) + Drizzle ORM on the back, Better Auth for authentication. Bun workspaces with [mprocs](https://github.com/pvolok/mprocs) for dev orchestration and Vitest for tests.

## Getting started

```bash
bun install
```

### Database setup

This project uses Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) with Drizzle ORM. Local development runs against a local D1 instance managed by `wrangler dev`.

1. Copy the example environment file and fill in the values (any random strings work locally):

```bash
cp apps/server/.dev.vars.example apps/server/.dev.vars
```

`apps/server/.dev.vars` needs `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `CORS_ORIGIN`, and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (a base64-encoded 32-byte key, e.g. `openssl rand -base64 32`).

2. Apply the schema:

```bash
bun db:push
```

### Run it

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) for the web app. The API runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Self-hosting

OpenWrite deploys as a single Cloudflare Worker (API + static frontend) backed by a D1 database — comfortably within Cloudflare's free tier for personal use:

```bash
wrangler d1 create your-database        # then update apps/server/wrangler.jsonc
wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET  # plus BETTER_AUTH_URL, CORS_ORIGIN, ENCRYPTION_KEY
bun run deploy
```

- `bun build` — build all applications
- `bun dev:web` / `bun dev:server` — start a single app
- `bun test` — run the Vitest suites (web + server)
- `bun quality` — type checking + linting (run before committing)
- `bun db:push` — push schema changes to the database
- `bun db:studio` — open the Drizzle Studio database UI
- `bun run deploy` — build and deploy to Cloudflare
